# NonMCPatientPlot
Here I am sharing with you my experience with one of the most popular data analysis tool that became essential for entry-level and seniors in the data analysis field. 
It was the first time using the R language and Rstudio via anaconda3 navigator. It was hectic at the beginning since I had a small problem with the installation directory, but without problems and error, we won't learn right!. 
I conducted data analysis on US patient dataset to answer the question: Do payment from non-medicare sources differ in; interesting, meaningful ways by Medicare Severity-Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG), state, or both? if so, how?
